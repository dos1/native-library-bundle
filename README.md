# What is this?

A repository containing pre-compiled libraries and their respective headers for use in various projects. The libraries are as follows per platform:

*(Assume Android to include armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64 and mips architectures)*

*(Assume Windows to mean only 64-bit, because 32-bit is dead)*

*(Assume iOS to include 32-bit and 64-bit architectures)*

*(Assume OSX to include only 64-bit)*
